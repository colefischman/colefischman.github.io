<b><p>About me</p></b>
<br> <tab> As you know, my name is Cole Fischman. My whole life I've had a passion for creative expression. For the past few years, I've turned more towards digital art. Things on programs such as (Adobe) Photoshop/Illustrator. Stemming from that, Ive found that videography and the editing process of such is my true passion. Now this isn't something that I attend school for. I go to school for business simply because its applicable nomatter where I go in life. Although right now it looks to be within the videography industry, you never know. Other than that, there's not much left to tell.
